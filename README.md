## My Project Idea: Birthday Tracker Application

The project I want to build is a **birthday tracker application** that stores birthdays of people that the
user knows. The app will let the user know when it is someone's birthday. *Ideally* this would be through a
desktop or email notification, but it could also just be a message that displays when the user opens the
app. It will also be able to calculate how many days there are until someone's birthday, and how old they are
turning. The app will store information about the person whose birthday it is 
such as their interests and hobbies, which could help the user choose a gift for them when their birthday is 
coming up.

I've tried a few birthday reminder apps but *none* of them had any functionality to store gift ideas or information
about people like their interests that would help when thinking of gift ideas. These apps also tended to have
features that were behind a pay-wall. My motivation for this project is to make a birthday tracking app that
addresses these issues I have encountered. The target audience for the app will be any person who has birthdays they want to keep track of. It would
be most useful for people who are forgetful with dates and/or people who care about giving well-thought-out
gifts that other will actually like.
